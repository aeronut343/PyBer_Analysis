# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
This analysis takes ride sharing data from a company and analyzes the usage and income grouped by city type. The city types are "Urban", "Suburban", and "Rural" and they were predefined in the raw data. 

## Results
The total income from ride sharing was largest in the Urban areas, with Suburban areas bringing in about half of that and Rural areas bringing in about an eigth. This is shown in the summary chart below.

Unsurprisingly the amount of drivers available in each city category followed the same trend.
![Drivers by City Type](analysis/fig7)

The average fare for rural cities was the highest, likely due to low supply of drivers. Urban areas had the lowest average fares despite bringing in the bulk of the profit.


## Summary
### Business Recommendations
- Advertise more in Rural and Suburban cities
- Hire more drivers in Rural and Suburban cities
- Increase prices in Urban cities
